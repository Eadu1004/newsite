      <section>
      <p> Stranger Things is an American sci-fi television series created by the Duffer Brothers. It was first released as a Netflix original series on July 15, 2016.
  The show takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana in the mid 1980s. The first season, set in November 1983, follows numerous groups of characters as they separately investigate the disappearance of Will Byers. The subsequent second and third seasons expand the narrative scope, exploring the complex fallout from the events of November 1983. The fourth season further expands the show's scope, with major storylines taking place outside of Hawkins for the first time. A fifth season is in the works and is set to conclude the series.

  <p> Prior to 1983, Hawkins was a largely quiet and uneventful town. The last person to be reported missing prior to 1983 was in the summer of 1923, while the last suicide was in fall 1961. The only major incident of note was the Creel family tragedy of 1959, in which Victor Creel was believed to have brutally murdered his wife and two children. The greatest point of interest was the secretive Hawkins National Laboratory, one of several national laboratories which grew out of the scientific endeavors of the Second World War. </section>

  <p> Hawkins National Laboratory was a secretive federal complex located in Hawkins, Indiana, and was one of several national laboratories established following the Second World War. The lab controlled several subsidiaries, including Hawkins Power and Light. The lab was seemingly operated by the U.S. Department of Energy, though some speculated it was actually controlled, entirely or in part, by some other government agency, such as the CIA, or NSA. In any case, the lab was headed by Dr. Martin Brenner until the strange events of November 1983; Dr. Sam Owens then took over as Director of Operations. Unbeknownst to the residents of Hawkins, the lab hosted experiments for the controversial government program known as "MKUltra". These experiments yielded the births of a number of child test subjects with psychokinetic abilities, who were in turn experimented on. The test subjects were strictly confined to the lab premises, their existence kept top secret by the authorities.
